      "Question: What strategies influence sprint acceleration phases?\n",
      "Answer: - Technical setup and blocks\n",
      "  - Cue a 45° (or 42°) torso angle; ensure the shin line mirrors torso projection.\n",
      "  - Block spacing: about 45 cm front-to-front and 96 cm front-to-back.\n",
      "  - Drive the rear knee past hip level without the heel peeling outward.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Early acceleration mechanics (steps 1–8)\n",
      "  - Center of mass rises gradually from step 3; keep pelvis aligned (not behind the shoulders) to avoid braking.\n",
      "  - Knee lift kept within a 60° envelope relative to the hip.\n",
      "  - Shank angle stays inside about 50° through steps 7–9.\n",
      "  - Maintain a stiff ankle/ankle position (benefits from dorsiflexion or a slight heel drop to aid elastic rebound).\n",
      "\n",
      "- Force, cadence, and limb timing\n",
