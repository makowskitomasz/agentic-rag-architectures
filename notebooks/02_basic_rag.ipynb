            "Answer:\n",
            "Acceleration in sprinting is the staged process of converting block-driven impulse into forward velocity, controlled by body position, force application, and cadence.\n",
            "\n",
            "Key elements from the context:\n",
            "\n",
            "- Start and early drive\n",
            "  - Block setup and posture: aim for a torso angle around 45° (some debate for 42°); the initial shin line should mirror the torso to avoid diluting horizontal force.\n",
            "  - Ground contact: about 0.19 seconds in early contacts; these contacts supply the impulse to push the sprinter forward.\n",
            "  - Spacing: block front-to-front ~45 cm and front-to-back ~96 cm.\n",
            "  - COM and pelvis: from steps 3–8, the center of mass should rise gradually; the pelvis should stay under the shoulders—if the pelvis drifts behind, braking forces develop.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Force production and mechanics\n",
            "  - Step length and cadence: you push through roughly 0.8 m per step in the first ten strides; cadence rises toward about 4.5 strides per second.\n",
            "  - Muscles and joints: the posterior chain does much of the work; ankle stiffness affects how much force reaches the ground. Keeping the ankle dorsiflexed during stance can reduce energy loss (about 6%), with some athletes using a small heel drop to aid elastic rebound.\n",
            "  - Upper body timing: arms act as a metronome; the elbow angle should not expand beyond about 105° to maintain reciprocal timing and limit trunk over-rotation. Cueing the thumb to brush the hip pocket helps keep rhythm and a neutral pelvis.\n",
            "  - Leg alignment cues: the shank angle should stay inside ~50° through steps 7–9 to avoid lateral sway; avoid a 55° mismatch between legs.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Transition toward maximal velocity\n",
            "  - As acceleration progresses toward 30–60 m, the sprinter rises from roughly 30° to near vertical in the torso while keeping the head forward to avoid tilting the pelvis and disengaging the glutes.\n",
            "  - Stride length increases to around 2.3 m (about 2.4 m for taller indoors), and the goal is to match this longer length with timely front-side mechanics so the thigh reaches hip height before whipping downward.\n",
            "  - Cadence management is debated: some coaches target a steady ~4.6 strides per second, using length increases to drive speed; others allow a slight cadence drop if it yields more powerful hip extension. Both approaches require feedback to stay on form.\n",
            "\n",
            "- Neuromuscular and psychological aspects (supportive)\n",
            "  - Sprinting is neuromuscular: overspeed work (~102–104% of race velocity) trains staying relaxed while turning over faster.\n",
            "  - Training structure supports neural freshness: several high-quality accelerations with short rests.\n",
            "  - Mental script: athletes who “own the first three steps” tend to accelerate harder, and visualizations tied to the blocks and gun help align perception with mechanics.\n",
            "\n",
            "In short: acceleration works by generating immediate forward impulse from the blocks, maintaining precise alignment and timing to avoid braking, progressively increasing COM height, and transitioning to a longer, faster stride pattern as velocity rises toward maximal speed.\n",
